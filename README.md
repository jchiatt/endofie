# What is it?

It's the web development party of the century. On October 14, 2025, Microsoft will officially stop supporting IE 11, the last surving member of the dynasty of evil. We're gonna party like it's [no longer 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_version_history#Microsoft_Internet_Explorer_1.x).

# Who's invited?

You!

# Other details?

It's six years away, so more details will come as we plan the party. We'll be getting sponsors so we can truly make this an amazing party. The best way to stay up to date is to [sign up for emails here](https://mailchi.mp/77f84180ff5c/endofie).
